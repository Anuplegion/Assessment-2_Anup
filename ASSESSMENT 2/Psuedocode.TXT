Planning for the student management system

Step 1. Create classes and main method
	Classes : 
1.Student Class - Stores student information as an object and initialises all properties also calculates sum of marks for each student
2.StudentFile Class - read the csv file, parse string as double(marks maybe set as string in csv) also get the unit from the file.
3. Unit Class - saves unit name and list of students in unit, also used to print student wise marks and other required printing
4. Main class - main menu that provides interface for user interaction. 


Psuedocode for Student Class:

Class Student 
Properties : lastName, firstName, studentID, a1, a2, a3, totalMark
Constructors for all variables
Return total mark

Psuedocode for studentFile Class
Properties : List all student objects, make unit object
Initialise all students to empty list, initialise unit as a new unit
Readfile and parse data and also populate the student list with names
Give error if some error is faced.

Psuedocode for unit Class

Variables : name as string and students the list of students
Methods to set name, set student list and print student wise marks, print marks under threshold, print top and bottom students, also print all student details

Main class:
Provide interface for user to get the result they require.
