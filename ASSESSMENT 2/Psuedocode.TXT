Planning for the student management system

Step 1. Create classes and main method
	Classes : 
1.Student Class - Stores student information as an object and initialises all properties also calculates sum of marks for each student
2.StudentMarksManager Class - read the csv file, parse string as double(marks maybe set as string in csv) also get the unit from the file. And house all calculation methods
3. Main class - main menu that provides interface for user interaction. 


Plan for Student Class:
Class Student 
Properties : lastName, firstName, studentID, a1, a2, a3, totalMark
Constructors for all variables
Return total mark

Plan for MarksManager Class
Properties : List all student objects, make unit object
Initialise all students to empty list, initialise unit as a new unit
Readfile and parse data and also populate the student list with names
Give error if some error is faced.

Main class:
Provide interface for user to get the result they require.




Bubble Sort Algorithm:


Algorithm 3:print the list of students with total marks less than a certain threshold, take threshold from input

Take Input: threshold
Initialize studentsBelowThreshold as empty list
For each student in students:
    If student.getTotalMark() < threshold:
        Add student to studentsBelowThreshold
For each student in studentsBelowThreshold:
    Print student.firstName, student.lastName, student.studentID, student.getTotalMark()




Algorithm 4: print the top 5 students with the highest total marks and the top 5 students with the lowest total marks
